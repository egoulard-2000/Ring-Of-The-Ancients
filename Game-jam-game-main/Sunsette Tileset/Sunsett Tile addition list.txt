Ok so I have the base 16 grass tiles that I need. Now I want to expand the tileset with more terrain

Diagonal/Curved terrain tiles. Dont make one or other, make slightly curved only
path tile set that includes ramps that lead from level to level
Rock tile set for more mountainous terrain, this includes tiles for rock to grass and rock to water. rock to path optional
Water tile set. Make base water tile and then have overlayed bits that make the water more interesting. Animated optional
Bushes and trees. Make a variety of bushes and trees to use
Stand alone rocks
